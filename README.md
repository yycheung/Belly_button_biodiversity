# Belly Botton Biodiversity
## Overview

Importable Beef, a food startup is searching for bacterial species that have ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. We hypothesize that the ideal bacteria species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button, or at least in someone’s belly button. To test this hypothesis, we sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacteria species that colonize our belly buttons. Each person’s identity is anonymous, they’ve instead been assigned an ID number.

This project is mainly focused on developing a dashboard that both research participants and fellow researchers can access. Those who participates in the study will be able to visit this website and select their ID numbers to see which bacteria species live in their navels.
